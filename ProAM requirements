# Overview

 The Missoula Pro am is a uniquely formatted timbersports cmpetition. It contain's 2 days of competition: A college competition on Day 1 (Friday) and a professional competition on Day 2 (Saturday). T The formats for the pro show and tghe college show are different. I will detail them below. 

# College Competition:

## Format
* "Teams" are organized by school and can have up to 8 total competitors on them. They MUST have a minimum of 2 competitors per gender. Schools can send as many teams as they want. 

    * For example, Universtiy of Montana could send UM-A (6 Males, 2 Females), UM-B (4 Males, 4 Females), and UM-C (3 Males, 2 Females). Colorado State University could send CSU-A (2 males, 6 Females), CSU-B (5 males, 3 Females), and CSU-C (4 males, 4 females). 

* The events will attempt to run in a solid batch of heats, with some deliberate exceptions. For instance, you should run all of men's single buck and then all of women's singlebuck.

## Gendered Segregation
* Men's and women's events are run separately, meaning that there will need to be a men's heat and women's heat for each event (For example, we will need to build a Men's Underhand Hard Hit and a Women's underhand Hard Hit).

## Partnered Events
Partnered events require two competitors from the same team to compete. These pairs are NOT randomly assigned, they are deliberately assigned during the entry process
The exception to the gender segregation rule applies to the following partnered events: 
    
        Pulp Toss
        Peavey Log Roll
        Jack & Jill Sawing

In any of these events, one man and one woman will compete with eachother in a team. Though Double Buck is a gender segregated event, it is still a partnered event and will require either 2 men or 2 women 

## Scoring

* The College competitions are formatted and scored to be both an individual and team event. 

* Individual scores are tracked throughout the day and are based off of placing. The following schema is used to assign points: 1st Place: 10 points, 2nd PLace: 7 Points, 3rd Place: 5 points, 4th Place: 3 points, 5th place: 2 points, 6th place, 1 point.

* Individual scores are also combined to form Team scores. For instance, If Bill from UM-A has 24 points, Sally from UM-B has 31 points, Steve From UM-A has 11 points, Mary from UM-B has 19 points, and Susan from UM-C has 9 points, then the team totals would be UM-A: 35 points, UM-B: 50 points, UM-C: 9 points. 

* College competitions have events that can be measured by time, points, distance, or number of hits. For the events that are reliant on time, the lowest time will be scored the highest. For Events that are scored by points, the highest amount of points will be scored the highest. For events that are scored in distance, the greatest distance will be scored the highest. For events that are scored by the number of hits (all events designated as a Hard Hit), the fewest number of hits gets scored the highest.

    ### Bull/Belle and Overall Team
    * At the end of both days of competition, we will need a tabulation of the top 5 College Teams, as well as the top 5 individual Men and the top 5 individual women. The top overall man is designated as "Bull of the Woods" and the top overall woman is designated as the "Belle of the Woods" 
* At the end of both days, in addition to the overall and team scores, there will need to be a printout of the results of every single event.

## Events Lists

* College Events also differ from pro events in that there are OPEN and CLOSED events. 

    * OPEN events are events that all competitors are signed up for. They are run at the beginning of the day and sometimes through the competition as needed. There is no set heat list, competitors come and go as their schedule allows. IMPORTANT NOTE: In recent years to save time and resources, the Missoula Pro Am has listed traditionally OPEN events as CLOSED (counts against Atheletes' 6 events). When we build the tournament from the beginning, I want the option to designate this specific set of events as *either* OPEN  or CLOSED. 

    ### THE FOLLOWING EVENTS ARE DESIGNATED AS OPEN EVENTS AT THE MISSOULA PRO-AM

        Axe Throw (score)
        Peavy Log Roll (time)
        Caber Toss (distance)
        Pulp Toss (time)


    * CLOSED events are events are ones that the athletes sign up for specifically. Athletes are allowed to sign up for a maximum of 6 events.

    ### THE FOLLOWING EVENTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CLOSED EVENTS AT THE MISSOULA PRO-AM

        Underhand Hard Hit (number of hits)
        Underhand Speed (time)
        Standing Block Hard Hit (number of hits)
        Standing Block Speed (time)
        Single Buck (time)
        Double Buck (time)
        Jack & Jill Sawing (time)
        Stock Saw (time)
        Speed Climb (time)
        Obstacle Pole (time)
        Chokerman's Race (time)
        Birling (bracket)
        1-Board Spring Board

## Special Rules for events

* Chokerman's Race, Obstacle Pole, and Climb will require 2x runs built into the schedule. For each of these events, you are running head-to-head against another opponent on a nearly similar course. A second run helps eliminate bias or an unfair advantage that one course has over the other. In these timed events, the fastest of these two times is used to score the event. For each of these events, the course will be defined as the following:

        Obstacle Pole: Pole 1/ Pole 2
        Chokerman's Race: Course 1/ Course 2
        Speed Climb: Pole 2/ Pole 4

* Birling will be held at the very end of the day. The Birling Bracket will be double elimination to determine a winner out to 6th. The bracket will be pre-seeded and designed prior to the competition's start
    
# "Friday Night Feature"
* The Friday Night Feature is run whenever there is either a set of special events, or there needs to be spillover due to scheduling. When we are designing the schedule, we will build this separately. If events are held on a Friday night, the following events are typically held: 

        Collegiate 1-Board
        Pro 1- Board 
        Pro 3- Board Jigger.  

# Professional Competition

## Format
* Unlike the college format where events are run one heat at a time and sequentially, the Profesisonal show runs on a "Flight" system, where a heat from each event is worked in to give the crowd a variety of events to watch at a fast pace. 

    For example, Flight 1 might look like the following:
    Springboard Heat 1
    Women's Single Buck Heat 1
    Men's Underhand Heat 1
    Cookie Stack Heat 1
    etc., etc., 

* The flights don't neccessarily have to have ONLY one heat from each event in the flight, but it does help with the crowd engagement to keep a wide variety. A good exampe of this would be to have a heat of the underhand, followed by 2 or 3 heats of the Obstacle Pole (it is a fast paced event that is a crowd pleaser and also has only two competitors at a time, so there will naturally be a lot of heats)

* It is important to group compettors by ability group ESPECIALLY IN THE SPRINGBOARD. If there are 4 competitors that cut 4+ minute sprigboards, it is helpful to put them all in the same heat to keep there from being 4x 4-minute Springboard heats.


## Gendered Segregation
* Men's and women's events are run separately, meaning that there will need to be a men's heat and women's heat for each event (For example, we will need to build a Men's Underhand and a Women's underhand).

* The exception will be the following events:
        
        Jack & Jill Sawing
        Birling (NOT GENDER SEGREGATED LIKE COLLEGE!)
        Pro 1-Board Springboard
        Obstacle Pole
        Cookie Stack

## Partnered Events
Partnered events require two competitors from to compete. These pairs are NOT randomly assigned, they are deliberately assigned during the entry process. The following events will be partnered events:

    Double Buck 
    Partnered Axe Throw
    Jack & Jill Sawing

During registration, if a partner is not explicitly listed on the form, I want a way for the system to auto-assign a partner.

## Scoring

* There is no show-wide tracking of points for pro competitors, but payouts need to be tracked. Payouts will vary by dollar amount and the placing that it will pay out to for every event and will be distributed at the end of the show.

* At the end of both days there will need to be a printout of the results of every single event.

* An example of the current college Scoring format is included in the project files:

## Events Lists

The Following Events may be hosted at the Missoula Pro-Am's Pro show:

    Springboard (time)
    Pro 1-Board (time)
    3- Baord Jigger (time)
    Underhand (time)
    Standing Block (time)
    Stock Saw (time)
    Hot Saw (time)
    Single Buck (time)
    Double Buck (time)
    Jack & Jill (time)
    Partnered Axe Throw (score)
    Obstacle Pole (time)
    Cookie Stack (time)
    Pole Climb (time)

This is not a definitive list, as events will be selected based on wood availability each year during the show design phase. It is also important to note that there is NOT a requirement to host both a men's and women's version of each event. (For example, many times the Pro Am will host the women's standing block, but not the men's standing block)

## Special Rules for events

* There are 4 dummies for springboard and each dummy can be used 3 times for each event. Left handed springbaord cutters need to be identified during the signup and assigned to the same dummy (spread out throughout the heats/flights). Wood calculations need to account for the amount of dummies needed.

* Birling will always be done as the last event of the pro show

* The pro Obstacle Pole will only be allotted ONE run

* Both Cookie Stack and Standing block will use the same stands! 

* All hand-sawing events (Single Buck, Double Buck, Jack & Jill) use the same 8 stands. Though there are 8 saw stands, they are grouped in sets of 4. One heat of sawing (4 stands) will go while the other heat (other 4 stands) sets in.

* All power-sawing events (stock saw and hot saw) will be executed on saw stands 1-4. Stock Saw (both pro and collegiate) will be held on stands 1 & 2

* Partnered Axe throw will be split into two parts: pre show preliminaries and the finals held during the show. All teams will throw off prior to the show, and the top 4 teams will throw at some point during the show. One team will throw off at some point during each flight. This means there needs to be a way to easily ammend the schedule with the teams that made the finals.


## College Event Integration

### College Events held on Satruday

* In the interest of time, some college events will need to be rolled to Saturday. They will be judged and scored like college events. The second run of the Chokerman's Race will absolutely need to be conducted Saturday. Depending on availability, the following are acceptable events from the college leagues that can be worked into the Saturday schedule if absolutely neccessary (their order reflects order of preference):

1. Men's Standing Block Speed
2. Men's Standing Block Hard Hit
3. Women's Standing Block Speed
4. Women's Standing Block Hard Hit
5. Men's Obstacle Pole

### "Pro-AM" Relay

One of the main purposes of the Missoula Pro Am is to create an enviornment that breaks down the divide between the college athletes and professional athletes. One of the the best ways we do this is with a "Pro-Am" relay. Two teams of will be randomly drawn prior to the start of the show. Each team will consist of 6 competitors: 3 college competitors, and 3 professional competitors. The teams will arrange themselves however they see fit to complete the following 3 events: partnered sawing (can be arranged with any combination ) sawing, Standing Butcher Block, Underhand Butcher Block.

This relay will need to be fit into one of the flights.

Both Professional Competitors will indicate their desire to be drawn into the Pro-Am relay on their entry forms.

NOTE: The results of this relay do not count towards team or individual college scores. This is also the ONLY event where the college competitors will be capable of winning money.


# Stand Allocation For Show (College and Pro)

    Springboard: 4 Stands
    Underhand: 5 Stands (could change )
    Obstacle Pole: 2 Sides (Pole 1/ Pole 2)
    Speed Climb: 2 poles (Pole 2, Pole 4)
    Standing Block: 5 stands
    Cookie Stack: 5 Stands
    Stock Saw: 2 Stands
    Hot Saw: 4 stands
    Single buck: 8 Stands
    Double Buck: 8 Stands
    Jack & Jill: 8 Stands
    Partnered Axe Throw: 1 target for finals

# Show Entry


## Professional Entries 
* Professional entries are done individually. At theend we can develop the most optimized entry form for the system.

* Professional entries will have entry fees. The enry fees will be by-event, and the price will vary with each event

* Professional entry form needs to ask whether they are a current American Lumberjack Assosciation (ALA) Member. There needs to be an option in the menu to check whether a memeber has self-reported current membership.

* Professional competitors will also indicate whether they are interested in entering the Pro-Am lottery when they register

* In addition to Events entered, we need to track a competitor's name, gender, address, phone number, email address, and shirt size (if show is providing shirts)

* The show may elect whether or not they are sneding shirts or not. This will be determined prior to the sending out of the entry forms.

* There needs to be an option to indicate whether or not you are sharing gear with another compeitor and what events you will be sharing the equipment. Some competitors share expensive gear or gear that is difficult to travel with like Springboards, hotsaws, or single saws. This is to prevent two competitors that are sharing from being put in the same heat.


## College Entries
* Colleges submit their entires by school. We have a working excel signup sheet already, and is included here:
