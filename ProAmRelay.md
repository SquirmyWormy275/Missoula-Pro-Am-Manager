### "Pro-AM" Relay

One of the main purposes of the Missoula Pro Am is to create an enviornment that breaks down the divide between the college athletes and professional athletes. One of the the best ways we do this is with a "Pro-Am" relay. Two teams of will be randomly drawn prior to the start of the show. Each team will consist of 6 competitors: 3 college competitors, and 3 professional competitors. The teams will arrange themselves however they see fit to complete the following 3 events: partnered sawing (can be arranged with any combination of genders) sawing, Standing Butcher Block, Underhand Butcher Block.

This relay will need to be fit into one of the flights.

Both Professional Competitors will indicate their desire to be drawn into the Pro-Am relay on their entry forms.

NOTE: The results of this relay do not count towards team or individual college scores. This is also the ONLY event where the college competitors will be capable of winning money.
