### "Pro-AM" Relay

One of the main purposes of the Missoula Pro Am is to create an environment that breaks down the divide between college athletes and professional athletes. One of the best ways we do this is with a "Pro-Am" relay.

Teams will be randomly drawn prior to the start of the show based on the total number of applicants. Each team consists of exactly 8 competitors:

- 2 Professional Men
- 2 Professional Women
- 2 College Men
- 2 College Women

Teams may arrange themselves however they see fit across all 4 events, which are competed in the following order:

1. Partnered Sawing
2. Standing Butcher Block
3. Underhand Butcher Block
4. Team Axe Throw — time stops when the balloon is popped

This relay will be fit into one of the flights.

> **NOTE:** The results of this relay do not count towards team or individual college scores. This is the ONLY event where college competitors are eligible to win prize money. Entry into the relay lottery costs **$5** regardless of whether you are drawn. **Participation is not guaranteed.**
